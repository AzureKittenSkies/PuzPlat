Fish following are very cute



Game sounds fun and good. A little bit advanced and "out of field" but still sounds good.

It's adorable and the mechanics are really nice. Scrificing fish is fun.

Unique and innovative (haven't seen that idea before), and sounds like it will be a lot of fun.

Unique idea. Jumps get a bit ridiculous with large numbers of fish. Orbiting fish is cool. Doors could use more intuitive indicators to show whether they are open/closed.
